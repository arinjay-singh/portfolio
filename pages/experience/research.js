                Economics Research Assistant, Co-Author to Professor Xialon Shi
              </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>June 2023 - Present</strong>
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I started as a research assistant for Professor Xialon Shi in June
              2023. I am currently working on a research paper that builds upon
              her previous work on the effects of granchildren on the health of
              grandparents.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The research explores this relationship through two differnent
              lenses: the causal effect that the birth of grandchildren have on
              grandparents' retirement decisions and the health implications of
              grandparents co-residing with their grandchildren.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              In this role, I am utilizing statistical analysis software such as
              Stata, R, and Python to apply Difference-in-Difference Estimation
              and Regression Discontinuity Design to a dataset of
              grandparent-grandchild pairs obtained from the Panel Study of
              Income Dynamics provided by the University of Michiganâ€™s Institute
              for Social Research.
